# The Odin Programming Language Website

This is the repository for the official odin website: [https://odin-lang.org/](https://odin-lang.org/)

## How to Build

The website is built on [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Follow the instructions for your preferred platform. 

Once installed, simply run `hugo serve`, which will launch the site at localhost and watch for any file changes.

## Miscellaneous

We also use Bootstrap for styling, and the rest is done from scratch.
