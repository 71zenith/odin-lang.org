### Task Tagging

You can assign 1-8 tags to each task and switch between how the tags are showcased.

Edit the tag content to whatever your file needs.

Each tag also uses a customizable color from the theme.

### Bookmarks & Jumps

***Bookmarks*** can be assigned to each task to allow quick-jumping forwards/backwards.

### Cut, Copy & Paste

*Cut, Copy & Paste* can be done in 2 modes: Task | Text.

When no text is selected and you perform a cut/copy - the next mode will be a task cut/copy. The next paste will then result in copying all selected tasks with all attached data like tags.

Selecting text and performing a cut/copy will result in a paste of the normal text content.
