*Understanding the Odin Programming Language* is a digital book for both beginners and intermediate Odin programmers. You'll learn about procedures, **manual memory management**, parametric polymorphism, data-oriented design, and much more.

A programming language is a tool. **By understanding your tools, you will become a better craftsperson**. Therefore, on top of how to write Odin code, this book also provides explanations of why things work the way they do.

The target audience is anyone with some programming experience. Odin is a simple yet powerful language, making it **a great introduction to low-level programming**, regardless of your programming background.
