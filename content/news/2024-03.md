## Homeshift

Homeshift (title in progress) is a 2D-platformer inspired by games such as Kye by Colin Garbutt and Super Meat Boy. Its main goals are, firstly, to provide challenging platforming with simple to grasp controls, and more importantly, to be easily moddable. This has been achieved with the help of Tilengine – an open source retro graphics library written in C.

Tilengine has made handling levels and rendering rather painless. It has built in support for loading .tmx files from Tiled, as well as out of the box parallax layers and other graphical effects, such as CRT- and per scanline filters.

As seen on video, levels are configured with .json files and loaded at runtime. This makes iteration fast, and opens the door for easy modification by players.

The biggest pain point with Tilengine has been its at times lacking documentation. However, it has for the most part been a very pleasant library to use. The best part of development so far, though, has been Odin and the wonderful community surrounding it. The language feels very well suited for game development, with built in vector support improving life quality by at least 10%. Figuring out memory management and such has been a breeze with the help of Karl Zylinski and other lovely Odin gamedev folk.

Parallax layers and sprite animations. Featuring my favourite level and a cute looking, yet dangerous, ghost.

## Cat & Onion

CAT & ONION is a whimsical cat adventure game. It's written in Odin and uses Raylib for graphics, audio and input. The game is a short story that plays like an adventure game combined with a 2D side-scroller: Talk to the beings of the forest, find items and progress a strange story. The game will take you places where no cat has ever gone before!

### Why Odin?

Odin was chosen because it was “low level with a high level feeling”, meaning that it was possible to do all the low stuff one would normally do in C while also empowering creative gameplay programming through Odin’s modern features.

### Rapid prototyping with Hot Reload

During the development hot reload of the Odin code has been used to quickly iterate on gameplay. It was easy to implement using the `dynlib` package in Odin's core library. Karl has written a blog post about his hot reloading setup [here](http://zylinski.se/posts/hot-reload-gameplay-code/).

### Odin and Raylib works well together!

Raylib suits Odin well due to its simple C API. But when you use it with Odin you get added benefits such as no name collisions, thanks to Odin's package system. Raylib allowed Karl to quickly prototype graphics and gameplay, while it has enough features to actually also ship a game.

### Release on March 12

The game will release March 12 on Steam. It will be the first game released on Steam to use Odin. It is possible to wishlist it here: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2781210/CAT__ONION/
