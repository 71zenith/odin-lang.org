## Documentation Update

Feoramund has updated the Documentation on the odin test runner https://odin-lang.org/docs/testing/. It goes into detail, what everyone will eventually have to dive into for more serious projects.

## Introduction To Odin (karl_zylinski)

A big problem with learning a new language is the sparse quality material that's out there. Languages like Rust have tons of learning material and blogs posts about each aspect of the language out there.

After Karl Zylinski has published his game "Cat & Onion", he is stepping up to try and improve this area. We're happy to see more advancement for odin in this regard. Our [discord](https://discord.com/invite/sVBPHEv) also has a channel #article-authoring where you can receive feedback on unpublished articles.

## An After Effects Plug-in In Odin? (graphisco)

Adobe After Effects has an extensive 3rd party plug-in ecosystem thanks to it's time tested C API. The usual language of choice to write AE plug-ins is of course C++. Through out the years my programming style evolved from using needlessly complicated C++ paradigms to a very C style C++. When Zig first appeared on my radar, I was really intrigued - a modern C replacement without all the cruft and not having to deal with C++. But it turned out to be not my cup of tea. Then I stumbled upon Odin and it seemed almost perfect. On top of it some of the features in Odin are tailor made to write computer graphics code. My initial view is to use Odin for small side projects and experiments but stick with C++ for commercial work.

After writing some Odin code (mostly small tools and helper libs) I liked it so much that I decided to go all in with Odin for my next commercial project. The biggest hurdle for me is not the language itself but getting used to managing a project without an IDE. I eventually managed to write the build scripts but an IDE is sure more comfy especially for building plug-ins. There are no official Odin bindings for the AE SDK and Adobe doesn't publish any XML metadata to generate these bindings programmatically. So I had to port the headers manually, which in hindsight wasn't that bad.

Now on to the language itself - it's very well thought out consistent. It mostly fits in my head and doesn't encourage you to be clever. Just enough metaprogramming to take the edge off and a decent amount of syntax sugar to make it easy. There are so many nice touches and features in Odin (like defer, tagged unions, using,#no_bounds_check, transmute) that I like but I'll highlight just two which I think are very unique to Odin and found them very effective in practice.

### Feature 1: context 

The biggest feature for me is the language level support for custom allocators and how they're all hidden in the background using the context. For AE plug-ins most if not all memory has to be allocated by the host, so plug-ins rely on custom allocators extensively, so this feature works amazingly well. This also let's me have different allocators (persistent allocator & a frame allocator for example) for different procedures without any hassle.

### Feature 2: or_return

This is another feature I've come to rely upon frequently. It's very simple, yet so effective. Great for error propagation and a lot cleaner than throwing a C++ exception. Multiple return values make this an absolute delight. The AE SDK is full of functions that return a Error value and this really makes it a breeze. It's sister keyword or_else is also another gem.

Also the Discord community is incredibly helpful and always guided me in the right direction, which I'm very grateful for. I'm glad that I decided to take the leap and it all worked out very well.
