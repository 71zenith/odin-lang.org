## New / Updated Packages

I'll try posting the comments the authors posted for their packages.

### Odin Dear ImGui - `L4`

[odin-imgui](https://gitlab.com/L-4/odin-imgui) Generated Dear ImGui bindings using dear_bindings

* Generates bindings for both the `master` and `docking` ImGui branches, using [`dear_bindings`](https://github.com/dearimgui/dear_bindings)
* Contains bindings for most of the Dear ImGui implementations
* All backends which exist in `vendor:` have bindings
* These include: `vulkan, sdl2, opengl3, sdlrenderer2, glfw, dx11, dx12, win32, osx, metal`
* Compiles bindings as well as any wanted backends
* Tested on Windows, Linux, and Mac
* Includes several examples which can be used as a reference
* `GLFW + OpenGL, SDL2 + D3D11, SDL2 + Metal, SDL2 + OpenGL, SDL2 + SDL2 Renderer, SDL2 + Vulkan`


### LBP-Serialization - `jakubtomsu (Jacob)`

[LBP-Serialization](https://github.com/jakubtomsu/odin-lbp-serialization) "I made my LBP serialization code open-source, it's still kinda experimental though."

Here are the benefits of this method:
* single procedure for both serialization and deserialization
* full backwards compatibility is extremely easy
* good control over the exact data layout if necessary
* no RTTI

This is how easy it is to serialize complex datastructures:

```odin
Foo :: struct {
    a:          i32,
    b:          f32,
    name:       string,
}

Bar :: struct {
    foos: [dynamic]Foo,
    data: map[i32]bit_set[0 ..< 8],
}

serialize_foo :: proc(s: ^Serializer, foo: ^Foo, loc := #caller_location) -> bool {
    serialize(s, &foo.a, loc) or_return
    serialize(s, &foo.b, loc) or_return
    serialize(s, &foo.name, loc) or_return
    return true
}

serialize_bar :: proc(s: ^Serializer, bar: ^Bar, loc := #caller_location) -> bool {
    serialize(s, &bar.foos) or_return
    serialize(s, &bar.data) or_return
    return true
}
```

### Getopts - `Pix`
[Getopts](https://github.com/Pix-xiP/getopts) A Odin command line argument parser, loosely based on the `getopts_long`.

```odin
opts := init_opts()
defer deinit_opts(&opts)
{ // Scoping for easy scope of using.
  using optarg_opt
  add_arg(&opts, "flag", .NO_ARGUMENT)
  add_arg(&opts, "opt-argument", .OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT)
  add_arg(&opts, "required", .REQUIRED_ARGUMENT)
  add_arg(&opts, "h", .NO_ARGUMENT, "help") // Alternative name // long_opt
  add_arg(&opts, "m", .OPTIONAL_ARGUMENT, "my_flag_here")

}
getopt_long(os.args, &opts)
// Parse opts:
for opt in opts.opts {
  if ! opt.set do continue // allows to skip non set options.
  switch opt.name { // name will always be set, don't have to check both
    case "flag":
      // Something
    case "required":
      // Something else 
    case:
      // default? Usage!
  }  
}
```
