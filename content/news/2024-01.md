Odin is on the journey to 1.0! You can read up on all changes in the [monthly release]((https://github.com/odin-lang/Odin/releases/tag/dev-2024-02)) notes.

## Reddit
Karl Zylinski opened up a reddit again! Check it out here [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/odinlang/).
Personally I've left reddit but building up communities other than discord is good. The same applies to searching for odin help online.

## Games

We've got a whopping ***3 Games*** this month! I'm very excited to show them off here, so please check them out.

### ***Solar Storm*** from `Jakub`

"Solar Storm steam page is live!
It's still fairly work-in-progress, the screenshots are outdated and there is no trailer, but I'm working on it!
Wishlists are greatly appereciated!!"

Also I'm also doing a first public playtest this weekend, if anyone is interested, join solar storm discord server to participate: https://discord.com/invite/wn5jMMMYe4

Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/app/2754920/Solar_Storm/

### ***The Legend of J√°n √ètor*** from `Colin Bellino`

"Made a small game using my custom/handmade framework built in Odin.
It was built in about a week for a the pirate game jam. It's not great but it was the occasion to do some dog-fooding and that worked out well, my list of bug fixes and missing features just doubled \o/"

### ***CAT & ONION*** from `karl_zylinski`

"My game CAT & ONION is now released on itch! https://zylinski.itch.io/cat-and-onion

It's a warm adventure game where you play as a cat who goes on a surreal lil journey üê±

It has taken me months to make and I'm very proud to have finished a game all by myself. It is written in Odin + Raylib.

When you buy on itch you also get a drop of the source code. It's quite a chaotic code base, full of both good and bad things. The good parts is in my opinion the editor tools and the hot reloading etc. The bad parts is the entity system and the physics."

### Dynlib Helpers by Jeroen

Useful new helper added to `core:dynlib` to automagically populate a struct with procedure and global pointers from a DLL (or other shared lib depending on platform).

```odin
package example

import "core:dynlib"
import "core:fmt"

Symbols :: struct {
    // `foo_` is prefixed, so we look for the symbol `foo_add`.
    add: proc "c" (int, int) -> int,
    // We use the tag here to override the symbol to look for, namely `bar_sub`.
    sub: proc "c" (int, int) -> int `dynlib:"bar_sub"`,

    // Exported global (if exporting an i32, the type must be ^i32 because the symbol is a pointer to the export.)
    // If it's not a pointer or procedure type, we'll skip the struct field.
    hellope: ^i32,

    // Handle to free library.
    // We can have more than one of these so we can match symbols for more than one DLL with one struct.
    _my_lib_handle: dynlib.Library,
}

main :: proc() {
    sym: Symbols

    // Load symbols from `lib.dll` into Symbols struct.
    // Each struct field is prefixed with `foo_` before lookup in the DLL's symbol table.
    // The library's Handle (to unload) will be stored in `sym._my_lib_handle`. This way you can load multiple DLLs in one struct.
    count, ok := dynlib.initialize_symbols(&sym, "lib.dll", "foo_", "_my_lib_handle")
    defer dynlib.unload_library(sym._my_lib_handle)
    fmt.printf("ok: %v. %v symbols loaded from lib.dll (%p).\n", ok, count, sym._my_lib_handle)

    if count > 0 {
        fmt.println("42 + 42 =", sym.add(42, 42))
        fmt.println("84 - 13 =", sym.sub(84, 13))
        fmt.println("hellope =", sym.hellope^)
    }
}
```

Output
```
Creating library W:\Odin\core\dynlib\example\lib.lib and object W:\Odin\core\dynlib\example\lib.exp
ok: true. 3 symbols loaded from lib.dll (7FFDCF510000).
42 + 42 = 84
84 - 13 = 71
hellope = 42
```

### Odin / WASM / Webgl by thetarnav

"I've been slowly getting into learning Odin, WASM and WebGL
So I made a example project where I experiment with the three (and some js tooling for development/bundling)
Maybe it could be useful for somebody for reference or as a template
Also the wasm/js bindings there are rewritten into modules with types so it's a bit easier to understand and extend them (no more random typos)"
