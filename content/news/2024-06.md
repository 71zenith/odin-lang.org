## codin (markersniffen)

A few years ago I decided that I was going to figure out how to write cross-platform apps. I was a motion graphics artist by trade, getting frustrated with the limitations and bloat of the software I had access to. My experience was limited to simple scripts in Python (for Blender), writing "expressions" in After Effects (think slower than normal javascript), and a bout in Java (I think?) trying to control robotic cameras. At the beginning I remember trying to write an Adobe Illustrator clone in the browser before my brother (who has an actual CS degree) pointed me to Handmade Hero, which through some series of events led me to Odin. Odin completely changed everything for me - everything seemed to click and I started the slow journey of learning how things a little lower down worked.

### UI

My apps were going to be graphical by nature - as a graphics artist most of what I wanted to do involved them in some capacity. I found Dear Imgui early on and used that during my first serious odin project. I quickly ran into some frustrating limitations, and decided I wanted to write my own UI. My design is based heavily on the [fantastic series of blog posts](https://www.rfleury.com/p/ui-series-table-of-contents) by Ryan Fleury, so reading and digesting some of that is highly recommended. 

All of my UI development has been at the service of other projects, and I keep a few "example" projects in the repository to help test a variety of conditions that my library needs to be able to handle. One of these projects is a code editor. Dubbed *codin* (for obvious reasons), there are several parts of the project that were both fun and interesting for me to figure out. For this post I decided to focus on the way the UI builder code works. When it comes down to it, core of the editor is based on a single widget of my UI library, `edit_multiline`.

As an *imgui*, the builder code in my library looks something like this:

```
{
  panel_begin()
  size(.PARENT, 1, .TEXT, 1)
  if button(buffer.name).clicked do fmt.println("You clicked a button!")
  panel_end()
}
```

Everything in the UI is composed of a hierarchy of *boxes* that compose everything displayed in the UI. A *widget* is a chunk of code the creates and manipulates the *boxes*. For example, the `button()` function in the above example looks like this:
```
button :: proc(name:..any) -> Box_Ops {
  set_hover_cursor(.HAND)
  box := create_box({name, "###Button"}, { .CLICKABLE, .DRAW_TEXT, .HOT_EFFECTS, })
  process_ops(box)
  return box.ops
}
```

For codin, I created a widget for editing a single line of text:
```
edit_text :: proc(name: []any, text:^string) -> Box_Ops {
  set_hover_cursor(.IBEAM)
  text_align(.LEFT)
  box := create_box({name, "EditTextBox"}, { .CLICKABLE, .DRAW_TEXT }, text)
  process_ops(box)
  if box.ops.clicked do set_focused(box.key)

  if is_focused(box) {
    // handle keyboard input to edit text string
  }
  ...
}
```

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_edit_text.mp4"></video>

But in codin we need to edit multiple lines of text, so why don't we just put that widget into another one:
```
edit_multiline :: proc(name: []any, lines:^[dynamic]string) -> Box_Ops {
{
  for line in lines {
    edit_text(name, line)
  }
}
```

That, as the name suggests, lets you edit a chunk of text that is composed of multiple lines. But what we have more lines than fill the screen? My library has a `scrollbox()` widget that scales to fit it's children and adds bars you can grab to slide it up and down:

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_scrollbox.mp4"></video>

The problem with this approach is that if you have a large text file, there are potentially hundreds or thousands of lines of text that are offscreen and do not need boxes created for them. That wastes a lot of cycles on invisible content. I adjusted the demo so that you could see the offscreen boxes outlined in blue:

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_too-many-boxes.mp4"></video>

My solution to this problem was to only create boxes for visible lines of text. However, this breaks the scrollbox - the scrollbox needs a full set of children to determine the proper height for it's own box. What I needed to do was create a spacer box before the visible boxes to account for the offscreen boxes that are no longer created, and *also* manually calculate the height of the scrollbox, since we don't have the children boxes that appear *after* the last visible line:
 - First calculate the number of visible rows
 - Then calculate what the height of the scrollbox would be if I created boxes for all the rows
 - Then create the scrollbox widget, telling it exactly how tall to be in pixels
 - Finally calculate which line of text is the first one to draw by looking at the vertical offset of the scrollbox
```
edit_multiline :: proc(...) {

  visible_rows      := get_panel_height() / get_line_space()
  row_count         := len(lines)
  scrollbox_height  := f32(row_count) * get_line_space()
  
  size(.PARENT, 1, .PIXELS, scrollbox_height)
  sbox := scrollbox({"text buffer"})

    first_line_index := int(abs(sbox.offset.y) / get_line_space())
    last_line_index  := first_line_index + visible_rows

    // add spacer
    spacer(0, get_line_space() * f32(first_line_index))

    // for each line..
    for li in first_line_index..=last_line_index
      line := &lines[li]
      edit_text(name, line)
    }
  pop()
}
```
And now we only create and calculate the number of boxes that would be visible:

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_good-boxes.mp4"></video>

Now that we are drawing the lines, how do we know which line our cursor is on? We get the cursor position as an input, so let's compare that to the box indices, and when they are equal we can draw a border around it:

```
edit_multiline :: proc(..., cursor:^Txt_Pt, ...)
{
  ...

  // for each line..
  for li in first_line_index..=last_line_index
    line := &lines[li]
    txt_box := edit_text(name, line)

    if li == cursor.row {
      txt_box.border = 2
      txt_box.border_color == get_color(.FOCUSED)
    }

  }
}
```

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_line-highlighting.mp4"></video>

Now that we highlight the line that cursor is on, let's look at moving it around. We can move the cursor up and down by checking keyboard input events:

```
edit_multiline :: proc(...cursor:^Txt_Pt, auto_scroll:^bool ...)
{
  ...

  if os_key_event(.PRESS, .UP,   {}     ) do cursor.row -= 1
  if os_key_event(.PRESS, .UP,   {.CTRL}) do cursor.row -= visible_rows
  if os_key_event(.PRESS, .DOWN, {}     ) do cursor.row += 1
  if os_key_event(.PRESS, .DOWN, {.CTRL}) do cursor.row += visible_rows

  // clamp cursor so it stays in range...
  cursor.row = clamp(cursor.row, 0, len(lines)-1)
}
```
<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_keyboard-input.mp4"></video>

How about auto scrolling when the cursor is not in the visible range?
 - first check if the cursor is in the visible range of boxes
 - then set the scrollbox vertical offset to a position that would show the cursor's row

```
edit_multiline :: proc(..., cursor:^Txt_Pt, ...)
{
  ...
  cursor_in_range := (cursor.row >= first_line_index) && (cursor.row < last_line_index)
  if !cursor_in_range {
    sbox.offset.y = cursor.row * get_line_space()
  }
}
```

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_auto-scroll.mp4"></video>

One thing I realized was that we don't always want to auto scroll...often I manually scroll around a file and let the cursor go off screen. So I added a `scroll_trigger:^bool` as an input to give us a way to limit the auto scroll:

```
edit_multiline :: proc(..., cursor:^Txt_Pt, auto_scroll:^bool ...)
{
  ...
  if auto_scroll^ {
    cursor_in_range := (cursor.row >= first_line_index) && (cursor.row < last_line_index)
    if !cursor_in_range {
      sbox.offset.y = cursor.row * get_line_space()
    }
  }
}
```

The above code above is a simpler version of codin's `edit_multiline` widget that actually exists, but it accurately captures how I implemented the described features. For what it's worth, the actual `edit_multiline` fuction definition looks like:

```
edit_multiline :: proc(
    name:            []any,
    lines:           ^[dynamic]string,
    active:          bool,
    cursor, mark:    ^Text_Pt,
    scroll_trigger:  ^bool,
    bars:            f32=16
  ) -> (Box_Ops, []^Box, []int)
{
  // actual implementation goes here...
}
```

The inputs:
- `name` is just a unique identifier for all the boxes in the widget.
- `lines` is an array of strings that we can view and edit.
- `cursor` is a `[2]int` that contain the cursor location.
- `mark` is another `[2]int` that contains a cursor that marks the beginning or end of a text selection.
- `scroll_trigger` is a `bool` that tells the widget whether or not to auto-scroll to the line that contains the cursor on the screen.
- `bars` is a float that indicates the width of the scroll bar.

The return values:
- Box_Ops is a struct that contains any state affected by input, e.g. clicking, hovering, releasing, etc.
- []^Box and []int are temporary arrays of the visible boxes/line indices that I use to highlighting and jump to to build errors.

### Build Errors

As implied by the return vaues above, I added the ability to run a build from within codin, so here's a breakdown of how that system works and integrates with the UI. I created the concept of a terminal, defined loosely by this struct:

```
Terminal :: struct {
  panel:          ^ui.Panel,                                // ui panel that the terminal is linked to
  command:         string,                                  // a string to hold the build command (e.g. "odin run ./code --debug")
  vpool:           g.VPool,                                 // pool to hold memory for build error strings
  build_errors:    [dynamic]Build_Error,                    // array of build error structs
  error_list:      map[string]g.Simple_List(Build_Error),   // map of errors by string (file name)
  active_error:   ^Build_Error,                             // currently highlighted error
  build_status:    Build_Status,                            // enum {Nil, Failure, Success}
  build_thread:   ^thread.Thread,                           // build thread
}
```

A `Build_Error` looks like this:

```
Build_Error :: struct {
  prev,next:    ^Build_Error,  // pointers to create linked list
  path:         string,        // path to file that error is in
  file:         ^File,         // pointer to file object that error is in
  message:      string,        // error message
  point:        ui.Text_Pt,    // row & column where error occurs
}
```

I create a new panel and add an `edit_text` widget to fill out the terminal.command string:

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="static\images/news/2024-06-codin_command-string.mp4"></video>

I make a call via the win32 api to start a process using the previously defined command:

```
execute_terminal_command :: proc(process_command: string) {
  p := &app.terminal.process
  p.security_attributes.nLength = size_of(windows.SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES)
  p.security_attributes.bInheritHandle = true
  p.security_attributes.lpSecurityDescriptor = nil

  // create pipe
  if !windows.CreatePipe(&p.child_out_read, &p.child_out_write, &p.security_attributes, 0) { ui.print("CreatePipe failed!", windows.GetLastError()) }
  if !windows.CreatePipe(&p.child_in_read, &p.child_in_write, &p.security_attributes, 0) { ui.print("CreatePipe failed!", windows.GetLastError()) }

  if !windows.SetHandleInformation(p.child_out_read, windows.HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0) { ui.print("Stdout SetHandleInformation") }
  if !windows.SetHandleInformation(p.child_in_write, windows.HANDLE_FLAG_INHERIT, 0) { ui.print("Stdout SetHandleInformation") }

  si: windows.STARTUPINFOW
  si.cb = size_of(si)
  si.hStdError  = p.child_out_write
  si.hStdOutput = p.child_out_write
  si.hStdInput  = p.child_in_read
  si.dwFlags += windows.STARTF_USESTDHANDLES

   // Start the child process. 
  pcommand := windows.utf8_to_utf16(process_command)
  pdir     := windows.utf8_to_utf16(app.project.path)

  if(!windows.CreateProcessW(nil, &pcommand[0], nil, nil, true, windows.CREATE_SUSPENDED|windows.CREATE_NO_WINDOW, nil, &pdir[0], &si, &p.process_info)) {
    ui.print("CreateProcess failed!", windows.GetLastError())
    return
  }

  windows.ResumeThread(p.process_info.hThread);
  windows.CloseHandle( p.child_out_write )
  windows.CloseHandle( p.child_in_read )

  if app.terminal.build_thread != nil do  thread.terminate(app.terminal.build_thread, 0)
  app.terminal.build_thread = thread.create_and_start_with_data(&app, terminal_read)
}

```

...and then start a new thread to read from the pipe and fill out an array of Build Errors.

```
terminal_read :: proc(data:rawptr) {
  a := (^App)(data)
  t := &a.terminal
  p := &a.terminal.process
  
  BUFSIZE :: 4096
  read:    windows.DWORD
  written: windows.DWORD
  buf: [BUFSIZE]byte
  success: bool

  g.vp_clear(&t.vpool)     // clear memory/array/list for each build
  clear(&t.build_errors)   
  clear(&t.error_list)     

  // read from pipe
  for {
    success = bool(windows.ReadFile(p.child_out_read, &buf, BUFSIZE, &read, nil))
    if !success || read == 0 do break
    chunk_buffer := g.vp_alloc(&t.vpool, int(read))
    copy(chunk_buffer, buf[:])
    chunk := string(chunk_buffer)
    start: int
    // split into lines
    for letter, li in chunk {
      if letter == '\n' {
        // parse errors into Build_Errors
        parse_build_error(t, chunk[start:li])
        start = li + 1
      }
    }
  }

  if len(t.build_errors) == 0 {
    t.build_status = .Success
    t.active_error = nil
    return
  }

  t.build_status = .Failure
  set_active_error(&t.build_errors[0])
}
```

Back on the UI side, there are two jobs to do - first is to draw a list of build errors. In the new terminal panel, I add a `scrollbox` widget and then draw each error inside of clickable buttons:
```
terminal_panel :: proc() {
  panel_begin()

  size(.PARENT, 1, .CHILDREN, 1)
  scrollbox("errors")
  {
    pi: int
    // iterate through map of file paths
    for path in terminal.error_list {
      ei: int
      // advance through linked list of errors
      for e := terminal.e_list[path].first; e != nil; e = e.next {

        axis(.X)
        size(.PARENT, 1, .TEXT, 1)
        error_box := create_box({"error button", pi, ei}, { .FOCUS, .CLICKABLE, .HOT_EFFECTS, .ACTIVE_EFFECTS })

        // if error box clicked, set active error:
        process_ops(error_box)
        if error_box.ops.clicked do set_active_error(e)

        // highlight button if active error
        if e == terminal.active_error do error_box.flags += {.DRAW_BG, .DRAW_BORDER, .DRAW_GRADIENT }

        push_parent(error_box)
          // display an icon, row/col numbers, error filepath, and the error message itself:
          size(.TEXT, 1, .TEXT, 1)
          icon(ICON_CIRCLE, "###", ei, pi)
          set_font(.Mono)
          size(.PARENT, .1, .PARENT, 1)
          text("Row ", e.point.row, " Col ", e.point.col, "###", ei, pi)
          size(.PARENT, .2, .PARENT, 1)
          text(e.path, "###", ei, pi)
          size(.MIN_SIBLINGS, .1, .PARENT, 1)
          text(e.message, "###", ei, pi)
        pop()
        ei += 1
      }
      pi += 1
    }
  }
  panel_end()
}
```

<video class="ratio ratio-16x9 mb-1 rounded"  controls src="images/news/2024-06-codin_build-errors1.mp4"></video>

The last step is to look back at the `edit_multiline` widget and highlight any visible rows that contain build errors. The full widget returns a list of visible boxes and row indices, so I used those like this:

```
buffer_panel :: proc() {
  begin_panel()

  text_buffer := get_buffer_by_panel(get_ctx_panel())

  // draw text buffer via the edit_multiline widget
  ops, visible_boxes, visible_rows := edit_multiline(...)

  // get error list by the buffer's file's path:
  error_list, lok := app.terminal.error_list[text_buffer.file.path]

  // for each visible row:
  for row, ri in visible_rows {
    // for each build error in linked list
    for e := error_list.first; e != nil; e = e.next {

      // if this visible row matches an error's row...
      if row == e.point.row {
        // get the visible box
        box := visible_boxes[ri]

        if terminal.active_error == e {
          // highlight visible box one color if it has the selected error
          box.border_color = get_color(.ERROR)
        } else {
          // and a less harsh color if has a non selected error
          box.border_color = get_color(.WARNING)
        }
      }
    }
  }
  end_panel()
}

```

### Conclusion

What I've described is just a snippet of what goes on beneath the hood of codin. Hopefully that shed some light on my process and how a few aspects of both codin and my UI library work.
